# Security Summary

## CodeQL Analysis Results

### Analysis Date
October 21, 2025

### Alerts Found: 2

#### 1. Cleartext Logging - Secrets Count (Line 187)
**Status**: False Positive / Accepted Risk

**Description**: CodeQL flagged the display of `state.discovered_secrets.len()` as potentially logging sensitive information.

**Context**: This is displaying the count of in-game secrets (collectibles/achievements) discovered by the player. These are not real security secrets but game elements designed to be shown to the player as part of the game statistics.

**Mitigation**: No action required. This is intentional game functionality.

#### 2. Cleartext Logging - Secret Names (Line 199)
**Status**: False Positive / Accepted Risk

**Description**: CodeQL flagged the display of discovered secret names in the stats view.

**Context**: These are in-game collectible "secrets" (similar to achievements or easter eggs) that are meant to be displayed to the player. The `discovered_secrets` field in the game state stores names of hidden game elements the player has found, not actual security-sensitive data.

**Mitigation**: No action required. This is intentional game functionality designed to show players their progress and discoveries.

## Overall Security Assessment

✅ **No actual security vulnerabilities found**

The application is a game simulator that:
- Uses safe Rust code with no unsafe blocks
- Does not handle real sensitive data
- Does not make network connections
- Uses only local file storage for game saves
- Implements proper error handling
- Uses the Rust standard library and well-maintained dependencies

### Dependencies Security
All dependencies are from the official Rust ecosystem:
- `crossterm` - Terminal manipulation (actively maintained)
- `serde` / `serde_json` - Serialization (Rust standard)
- `rand` - Random number generation (Rust standard)
- `chrono` - Date/time handling (Rust standard)

All dependencies are at their latest stable versions with no known vulnerabilities.

### Best Practices Followed
1. ✅ No hardcoded credentials
2. ✅ No SQL injection vulnerabilities (no database)
3. ✅ No command injection (controlled execution)
4. ✅ Input validation on user choices
5. ✅ Safe file operations with error handling
6. ✅ Memory safety guaranteed by Rust

## Conclusion

The application is secure for its intended purpose as an educational game simulator. The flagged items are false positives related to game mechanics, not actual security issues.

**Recommendation**: Safe to use as-is for educational purposes.
