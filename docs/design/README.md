## üéØ Design Philosophy

### Educational Game Architecture

1. **Progressive Learning**: Challenge difficulty scales with educational complexity
2. **Immersive Narrative**: Horror theme integration without compromising education
3. **Accessibility First**: Multiple difficulty levels and comprehensive hint systems

### Technical Architecture

1. **Modular Design**: Separation of concerns across game, challenges, UI, and state
2. **Terminal-First**: Cross-platform terminal UI with theme support
3. **Data-Driven**: Challenge system designed for easy content expansion

### Performance Considerations

1. **Responsive UI**: Sub-second response times for all user interactions
2. **Memory Efficiency**: Minimal allocations in hot paths
3. **Scalability**: Architecture supports 50+ challenges without performance degradation

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Core Modules

-   **Game Engine** (`game.rs`): Main loop, menu system, and user interaction
-   **Challenge System** (`challenges.rs`): Educational content and validation
-   **State Management** (`state.rs`): Persistence, statistics, and progress tracking
-   **UI Framework** (`ui.rs`): Terminal rendering, themes, and visual effects

### Data Flow

1. **User Input** ‚Üí Terminal capture and validation
2. **Game Logic** ‚Üí Challenge processing and state updates
3. **State Persistence** ‚Üí JSON serialization with error recovery
4. **UI Rendering** ‚Üí Themed terminal output with effects

### Extension Points

1. **Challenge Categories**: Modular system for new security domains
2. **Visual Themes**: Pluggable color and effect systems
3. **Narrative Elements**: Expandable horror story integration
4. **State Tracking**: Extensible player statistics and achievements

## üîÑ Design Patterns

### Educational Design

1. **Scaffolded Learning**: Progressive difficulty with comprehensive hints
2. **Contextual Teaching**: Challenges embedded in realistic scenarios
3. **Immediate Feedback**: Instant validation with educational explanations

### Technical Patterns

1. **State Machine**: Clear game state transitions and validation
2. **Observer Pattern**: UI updates based on state changes
3. **Strategy Pattern**: Pluggable challenge validation and theming
4. **Command Pattern**: User input processing and history

### Horror Integration

1. **Atmospheric Immersion**: Subtle environmental storytelling
2. **Sanity Mechanics**: Resource management affecting gameplay pacing
3. **Narrative Revelation**: Progressive story unfolding through gameplay

## üé® User Experience Design

### Accessibility

1. **Color Blind Support**: Multiple high-contrast themes
2. **Difficulty Options**: Hint systems and challenge skipping
3. **Clear Navigation**: Consistent command structure and help systems

### Engagement Mechanics

1. **Progress Visualization**: XP, levels, and completion tracking
2. **Achievement System**: Statistics and milestone recognition
3. **Narrative Hooks**: Compelling story integration maintaining educational focus
