## Why These Files Were Archived

### Consolidation Benefits

1. **Reduced Redundancy**: Multiple summary files contained overlapping information
2. **Improved Navigation**: Single comprehensive summary easier to navigate
3. **Better Maintenance**: Fewer files to maintain and keep current
4. **Clearer Structure**: Organized by logical feature areas instead of implementation chronology
5. **Enhanced Discoverability**: All implementation details in one authoritative source

### Information Preservation

All information from archived files has been:

- **Consolidated**: Merged into appropriate sections of IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md
- **Updated**: Refreshed with current status and any changes since original writing
- **Enhanced**: Added cross-references and improved organization
- **Maintained**: Preserved all technical details and implementation insights

## Accessing Archived Information

### If You Need Information from Archived Files

1. **First**: Check [IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md](../IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md) for the consolidated information
2. **Then**: Use the mapping above to find the relevant section
3. **If Missing**: Check archived files in this folder for specific details
4. **Report Gap**: If important information is missing from the new summary, please open an issue

### Historical Research

The archived files provide valuable historical context about:

- **Implementation Timeline**: When specific features were developed
- **Development Process**: How features evolved during implementation
- **Original Decisions**: Initial design rationale and trade-offs
- **Lessons Learned**: Insights specific to individual feature development

## Migration Notes

### Content Changes During Consolidation

- **Structure**: Reorganized by feature area instead of chronological implementation
- **Status Updates**: All status information updated to current state
- **Cross-References**: Added comprehensive links between related sections
- **Completeness**: Added missing information discovered during consolidation
- **Clarity**: Improved explanations and removed implementation-specific jargon

### What Was Not Migrated

- **Implementation-Specific Timestamps**: Exact dates of individual commits and PRs
- **Detailed Git History**: Specific commit references and pull request numbers
- **Intermediate Design Iterations**: Design decisions that were later changed
- **Developer Commentary**: Personal notes and informal implementation comments

These details are preserved in the archived files and git history.

## Future Archive Policy

### When Files Get Archived

Files are moved to archive when:

- **Superseded**: Replaced by newer, more comprehensive documentation
- **Consolidated**: Information merged into other documents
- **Outdated**: No longer relevant to current project state
- **Redundant**: Duplicate information exists in multiple places

### Retention Policy

Archived files are:

- **Preserved Indefinitely**: Maintained for historical reference
- **Not Updated**: No longer maintained or updated
- **Accessible**: Available for reference and research
- **Documented**: Clearly documented with replacement information

## Questions or Issues

If you need information from archived files or think something important was lost during consolidation:

- **Check**: [IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md](../IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md) first
- **Search**: Use repository search for specific terms
- **Ask**: Open a GitHub issue or discussion
- **Suggest**: Propose improvements to current documentation
